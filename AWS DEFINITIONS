IAM roles allow you to delegate access to users or services that normally don't have access to your organization's AWS resources. IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to make AWS API calls. Consequently, you don't have to share long-term credentials for access to a resource. Using IAM roles, 
it is possible to access cross-account resources.

consolidated billing allows all aws account in an organisation to be billed as one. it helps to reduce cost spent on aws resources.

AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related 
to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

aws VPN cloudhub is used If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub.

AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. 
It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, 
such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, 
such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic.

AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS. 
Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a private network connection between 
your on-premises data center and AWS. you are charged based on data sent outside AWS to other servers.

VPC sharing allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, 
into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets
with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can view,
create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources
that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.

the difference between fargate and lamda:
AWS Fargate is better suited for running long-lived containerized applications that require more control over resources and infrastructure, 
while AWS Lambda is ideal for event-driven, stateless functions with automatic scaling and minimal management overhead.
The choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements.

make sure the throughput for the fifo target does niot exceed 3000 messages per seconds. this achieved via batching of 10 queues each with 300 throughputs.

With bucket policies, you can grant users within your AWS Account or other AWS Accounts access to your Amazon S3 resources.

an AWS Gateway Endpoint is a networking feature that allows for secure and private communication between resources in your VPC and specific AWS services,
reducing exposure to the public internet and potentially lowering data transfer costs.
the two services that supports gateway endpoint = AMAZON S3 AND DYNAMODB. The rest of the AWS services use VPC interface endpoints.

Amazon Cognito User Pools is used to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, 
Google+, and Amazon. A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito.

A permissions boundary can be used to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principals (that is, users and roles) that they create and manage.


AWS Cost Explorer helps you identify under-utilized EC2 instances that may be downsized on an instance by instance basis within the same instance family, 
and also understand the potential impact on your AWS bill by taking into account your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.

AWS Compute Optimizer recommends optimal AWS Compute resources for your workloads to reduce costs and improve performance by using 
machine learning to analyze historical utilization metrics. Compute Optimizer helps you choose the optimal Amazon EC2 instance types,
including those that are part of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, based on your utilization data.

FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3

you cannot set up new aurora db instance and set it up as a read replica for the primary db.

Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices,
distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. SNS is a notification service.

 
MFA and versioning prevents accidental deletion of an object.

By default, the root volume for an AMI backed by Amazon EBS is deleted when the instance terminates. You can change the default behavior to ensure
that the volume persists after the instance terminates. Non-root EBS volumes remain available even after you terminate an instance to which the volumes were attached

A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances.
It is not possible to modify a launch configuration once it is created.

the reason for unhealthy response by ALB for an healthy instance:
the route for the health chcek is misconfigured, the SG of the the instance does not allow traffic from the SG o the LB.

these are the characteristics of ec2 user-data configuration:
-script excuted with user-data uses the root-user privilege
-by default, user-data runs only during the boot-cycle when you first launched an instance.

A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks.

in a NLB, If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the 
primary network interface for the instance

Job bookmarking is a mechanism that allows AWS Glue to keep track of where a job is left off in case it gets interrupted or fails for any reason

to change the instance type of a running instance, say from t2.micro to t2.large, create a new launch configuration and update the ASG. 

If your identity store is not compatible with SAML 2.0 then you can build a custom identity broker application to perform a similar function. 
this can be done using STS, SAML or custom identity broker.

AWS personal health shows events of your EC2 instance and other resource events logs

if Amazon SQS doesn't give the required decoupling essence, use FIFO and amazon Simple Work Flow (SWF)
Amazon SWF ensures that a task is never duplicated and its assigned only once.
